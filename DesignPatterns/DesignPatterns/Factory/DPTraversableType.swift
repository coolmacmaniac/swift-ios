/**
In programming there is a concept known as a **thunk** that can help us out with the shortcoming of generic protocols! A thunk is a helper struct/class that forwards calls from one object to another object. This is useful for scenarios where those two objects can't normally talk to one another. Using this, we can effectively erase our abstract generic protocol types in favor of another concrete, more fully-fledged type. This is often referred to as type erasure.

By creating a class that conforms to our original protocol and uses generics, we can more explicitly define our protocol's associated type.
